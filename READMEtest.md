# README.md Generator  ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)

## Description

This REPO was designed to help create a README.md file for future projects. I was motivated by my professor who assigned this project to our class. This will help myself, as well as others, create README's quickly for future REPO's being developed. During this project, I learned a lot about Node.js, Markdown, Licensing, and inserting badges to a README.md file.
